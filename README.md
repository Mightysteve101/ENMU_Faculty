Eastern New Mexico Directory Page Update

Update the Eastern New Mexico Faculty Page.

Faculty Page was an HTML document with each faculty member listed on top of each other. Faculty members wanted to have the page make them feel more unique from one another. The Goal of this project was to create a page that makes each faculty member have their own space. I will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and PHP. I have created a grid to organize each faculty member and use bootstrap to create 'Modules'. Instead of opening up a new page and adding more clicks we used pop up modules instead. I will have a feature where you click on a faculty member and a module pops ups showing the faculty members information. This information includes a bio, location, and past experience.
