# ENMU_Faculty
Eastern New Mexico Directory Page Update

I work as a Web Assistant for Eastern New Mexico University. I was given a task to rework and update ENMU's faculty page. The page was just a simple HTML document had an endless scroll to find each faculty member. With the help of my supervisor I was able to update the page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and PHP. I looked at D1 college directories to see how they organized their page. I created a grid to organize each faculty member and used bootstrap to create 'Modules'. Instead of opening a new page and adding clicked we used pop up modules. When you click on a faculty member a module pops ups showing the faculty members information. This information includes a bio, location, and past experience.
