Eastern New Mexico Directory Page Update

Update the Eastern New Mexico Faculty Page.

Faculty Page was an HTML document with each faculty member listed on top of each other. Faculty members wanted to have to page make them feel more unique from each other. The Goal of this project is create a page that makes each faculty member have there own space. I will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and PHP. I will created a grid to organize each faculty member and use bootstrap to create 'Modules'. Instead of opening a new page and adding clicked we used pop up modules. I will have a featuer where you click on a faculty member and a module pops ups showing the faculty members information. This information includes a bio, location, and past experience.
